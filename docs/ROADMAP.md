# MoltenCodes WoW Framework Roadmap

> Canonical development roadmap for the MoltenCodes WoW framework.

> This document is intentionally kept inside the repository so that project
> planning does not depend on chat history or external notes.

## Status

The framework is developed incrementally as small, reusable packages. Public
framework packages follow the Apple-like `Kit` convention:

- package IDs use **lowerCamelCase** (for example, `signalKit`)
- Lua/runtime facades use **PascalCase** (for example, `SignalKit`)
- `registry` / `Registry` is the infrastructure exception

Performance is a first-class requirement. New packages must minimize CPU time,
allocations, garbage-collector pressure, and retained memory. Caches and pools
must be bounded by default. Explicit developer opt-in escape hatches may relax
those defaults when they are documented and observable.

## Completed foundation

- [x] `registry`
- [x] `signalKit`
- [x] `eventKit`
- [x] `lifecycleKit`
- [x] `moduleKit`
- [x] `schedulerKit`
- [x] `timerKit`
- [x] `poolKit`

These entries describe packages present in this repository snapshot. A checked
item means its implementation is part of the repository; it does not mean the
package can never receive further optimization, fixes, or API refinement.

## Ongoing framework work

Work is sequenced in phases. A phase is finished when every checkbox in it is
ticked; later phases may start early only where they do not depend on an
unfinished item above them.

### Phase 0 — Green

Make every repository gate pass, so that later correctness work has a trustworthy
baseline to measure against.

- [x] Test support modules stop relying on Busted's injected globals: stub
      preconditions raise plain errors, genuine expectations `require("luassert")`.
- [x] Bootstrap specs clear the `package.loaded` sentinel between attempts so
      every bootstrap guard they claim to cover is really executed.
- [x] `tooling/test/run.py` runs every selected package, prints a per-package
      summary table, and exits non-zero when any package failed.
- [x] `tooling/test/run.py` names a concrete Lua 5.1 toolchain source when
      Busted is missing from `PATH`.
- [x] Tooling modules set `__doc__` (docstring above `from __future__ import`).
- [x] Selene reports zero errors and zero warnings; deliberate `_G` access is
      annotated per site with a reason.
- [x] `stylua --check .` passes across the repository.
- [x] `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` documents the concrete toolchain install path and
      troubleshooting.

### Phase 1 — Correctness fixes per package

Defects and hardening found by review, one package at a time. Every fix carries a
regression test.

- [x] **eventKit** — enforce the World of Warcraft unit-token limit on
      `ConnectUnit`/`OnceUnit` rather than letting the client silently truncate.
- [x] **eventKit** — isolate listeners at the event-bus boundary so one failing
      listener cannot stop delivery to the rest.
- [x] **eventKit** — bound the number of unit-group frames a single addon can
      cause to be created.
- [x] **eventKit** — audit `error` levels so messages point at the caller's line.
- [x] **moduleKit** — track the dispatched phase per module so an in-place
      upgrade never re-enables a module that was explicitly disabled.
- [x] **schedulerKit** — measure the frame budget as CPU time via
      `debugprofilestop` instead of wall-clock elapsed time.
- [x] **schedulerKit** — stop failing cooperating jobs when one job in the same
      frame raises.
- [x] **schedulerKit** — capture a traceback at the point of failure rather than
      after the stack has unwound.
- [x] **schedulerKit** — document the Lua 5.1 rule that a coroutine cannot yield
      across a `pcall` boundary, and make the API shape that rule explicit.
- [x] **registry** — let two API generations of the same package coexist instead
      of the newer one displacing the older.
- [x] **signalKit** — validate receivers at connect time.
- [x] **signalKit** — make disconnect cheaper than the current linear scan.
- [x] **timerKit** — audit `error` levels and correct the documentation that
      describes them.
- [x] **poolKit** — audit `error` levels and correct the documentation that
      describes them.

### Phase 2 — Consumer story

Everything an addon author needs in order to actually embed a package.

- [x] Write `docs/EMBEDDING.md` covering `.toc` entries, required load order,
      supported Interface numbers, coexistence with LibStub-based libraries,
      taint rules, and the combat-log (CLEU) constraints.
- [x] Ship a complete example addon under `examples/`, loaded by its own spec and
      type-checked on every run so the documented instructions cannot rot.
- [x] Add `.pkgmeta` and the packaging metadata the standard addon packagers
      expect.
- [x] Make `docs/RELEASES.md` describe tooling that exists: `tooling/package/build.py`
      assembles a checksummed, reproducible bundle for one Kit or the whole
      framework.
- [x] Give every public surface LuaCATS annotations so editors and the language
      server describe the API correctly, in one `---@` style, with `meta/wow/`
      definitions for the client API the Kits touch.

### Phase 3 — Engineering system

Repository mechanics that keep the above honest as the framework grows.

- [x] Pin every GitHub Action to a commit SHA rather than a moving tag, with the
      release the SHA was taken from in a trailing comment. The StyLua action no
      longer receives `GITHUB_TOKEN`; it only needed one to raise the anonymous
      API rate limit.
- [x] Run Selene over test code too, using a Busted std definition. `busted.yml`
      is selected by `selene-tests.toml`; `tooling/lint.py` lints
      `packages/*/tests`, `examples/tests` and the shared fixture under it, and
      reports zero errors and zero warnings.
- [x] Add a Python version floor row to the CI matrix so the documented minimum
      is actually exercised. `pyproject.toml` declares `requires-python`,
      repository validation enforces it, and CI runs the tooling tests on 3.10
      and 3.13.
- [x] Stop recompiling Selene in CI. It now installs the published
      `selene-light` binary and verifies a recorded SHA-256, which removes the
      build rather than caching it.
- [x] Extract the repeated WoW-API stubs into one shared test-support fixture,
      including the inline stub in `examples/tests/`. `tests/support/FrameworkTestEnv.lua`
      is the one fake client; each package keeps a thin `tests/support/<Kit>TestEnv.lua`.
- [x] Add a `Registry:Bootstrap` helper so packages stop copying the same
      bootstrap preamble. All seven Kits use it; Registry does not, because it
      publishes the facade the helper lives on.
- [x] Write `packages/moduleKit/docs/INTERNALS.md` describing the dependency
      graph and resolution order.

### Phase 4 — Growing the framework from what the ecosystem taught

Decided 2026-09-23 after a study of seven references (Ace3 and LibStub,
LibRangeCheck-3.0, LibSpellRange-1.0, WeakAuras_SharedMedia, LibGetFrame-1.0,
and the 309-entry WowAce library directory). Ideas and designs were taken,
never code. The work is sequenced in five packages, A to E; each package ends
with an acceptance review before the next begins. A new Kit is recorded here
with the nine points of the "Planned package policy" before its code is
written; capabilities added to an existing Kit are checkboxes under that Kit.

Decisions taken for the sequence: one `clientKit` holds both client detection
and compatibility shims; the combat gate lives in `lifecycleKit`; `codecKit`
is three stages (serialise, compress, channel-encode) rather than a bare
serialiser; `schemaKit` is the shared validation core written before the Kits
that use it; `settingsKit` v1 ships profiles, spec-aware profiles and
namespaces follow in v2; event coalescing and scheduler lanes are one design.

#### Package A — the gaps the references exposed in existing Kits

- [x] **eventKit** — owner scopes: `CreateScope`, `scope:Connect/Once/ConnectUnit`,
      `scope:DisconnectAll`, `scope:Close`, mirroring timerKit; bulk teardown
      of an addon's subscriptions in one call.
- [x] **timerKit** — `timer:GetRemaining()` and `timer:GetDeadline()` from the
      monotonic clock, `nil` (never `0`) when the timer is not running.
- [x] **poolKit** — generation stamping: objects built by a superseded factory
      are recognised after an in-place upgrade and retired rather than reused.
- [x] **poolKit** — pools for objects that can never be freed (frames): a
      creation cap, a live limit with a bounded waiting queue, cascading
      release of children, and release deferred until an animation ends.
- [x] **moduleKit** — automatic teardown: what a module registered through the
      framework while enabled (events, timers, scheduler jobs) is released
      when it is disabled, without the module writing an `OnDisable`.
- [x] **moduleKit** — intent versus fact: "wanted enabled" recorded separately
      from "is enabled", so a module blocked by a failed dependency is
      enabled again when the dependency recovers.
- [x] **registry** — `Find(package, api)` (silent lookup for optional
      dependencies) and `Packages()` (sorted enumeration for diagnostics).
- [x] **registry** — retirement and migration: the outgoing copy hands its
      state over and disables its own entry points; the incoming copy runs
      per-revision migrations in order.
- [x] **registry** — sealed facades: an option on `Bootstrap` that refuses
      writes to a published facade from outside its package.
- [x] **docs / meta / tooling** — secret values (`issecretvalue`) and
      restricted frame access (`IsForbidden`, `CanBeAccessedInContext`) in
      the taint section and in `meta/wow`; one validated table of supported
      `## Interface` numbers used by every document, the example and the
      packager; the TOC fields the addon sites read; the `externals` form for
      consumers; a spell-check gate.

#### Package B — foundations every later Kit needs

- [x] `clientKit` — client flavour, build floor, capability flags, normalised
      shims, `IsSecret`, `CanAccessFrame`, event validity probes.
- [x] `cacheKit` — bounded LRU and TTL caches, `Memoize`, diffed `Snapshot`,
      clear-on-event.
- [x] `profileKit` — zero-cost-when-off performance sections with count, total
      and spike, and a report.
- [ ] **schedulerKit** — `Debounce`, `Coalesce`, `Watch`, and lanes that
      ration a shared resource (in flight, interval, retry, backoff), designed
      with **eventKit** coalescing and `Derive` as one family.
- [ ] `readinessKit` — gates for host data that arrives after load, with
      timeouts and negative caching.
- [ ] **lifecycleKit** — the combat gate (one lockdown state, a bounded
      "run when out of combat" queue) and a halted state announced to
      dependents.

#### Package B planned Kits — the nine points

Recorded 2026-09-23, before implementation, as the planned package policy
requires. Sources: the phase 4 reference notes on LibRangeCheck-3.0,
LibSpellRange-1.0 and LibGetFrame-1.0 (client detection, caches, profiling).

**clientKit** — facade `ClientKit`

1. Package `clientKit`, facade `ClientKit`, API generation 1.
2. Purpose: one place that answers "which client is this and what can it
   do", and normalised shims for the few host calls whose name or shape
   differs between flavours. Non-goals: gameplay data, range or spell logic,
   anything a domain library should own; no polyfill of missing features.
3. Dependencies: registry API 2 only.
4. Surface: `GetFlavor()` (`"mainline" | "mists" | "tbc" | "classic"`),
   `GetBuild()` and `GetInterfaceNumber()`, `IsAtLeast(interfaceNumber)`,
   `Has(capability)` over a fixed, documented capability table
   (`C_AddOns`, `C_Spell`, `C_Item`, `C_Timer`, `secretValues`,
   `restrictedFrames`, `spellbookApi`, ...), `IsSecret(value)`,
   `CanAccessFrame(frame)`, `IsEventValid(eventName)`, and shims
   `GetAddOnMetadata`, `IsAddOnLoaded`, `GetSpellInfo`, `GetItemInfo`
   returning one shape on every flavour. Every flag reads `false` when the
   host does not expose the feature; an absent `WOW_PROJECT_ID` yields the
   most conservative flavour, never "everything true".
5. Ownership: stateless facade; the capability table is computed once at
   bootstrap and re-read on upgrade. Nothing to tear down.
6. Performance: each probe is a table read after bootstrap; shims add one
   call. No allocation after bootstrap.
7. Tests: one fixture profile per supported flavour (four), the
   `WOW_PROJECT_ID` absent case, the secret-value and forbidden-frame stubs,
   `IsEventValid` for a known, an unknown and an invalid name, upgrade.
8. Docs: README, API.md with the capability table and the shim shapes,
   EMBEDDING.md host-requirements row, CHANGELOG.
9. Status: implemented (package B1, 0.1.0).

**cacheKit** — facade `CacheKit`

1. Package `cacheKit`, facade `CacheKit`, API generation 1.
2. Purpose: bounded caches for consumers so "bounded by default" is a
   structure they reach for instead of a rule they remember: LRU by count,
   TTL by age, memoisation, snapshots with diffs, and clearing on a host
   event. Non-goals: persistence (settingsKit), cross-addon sharing.
3. Dependencies: registry API 2; eventKit API 1 optional (clear-on-event
   resolved through `Registry:Find`); a clock through the same fallback as
   timerKit (absent clock disables TTL, documented).
4. Surface: `CacheKit:NewLru{ maxEntries }`, `CacheKit:NewTtl{ maxEntries,
   ttlSeconds }` with `Get`, `Set`, `Peek`, `Delete`, `Clear`, `GetCount`,
   `GetStats()` (hits, misses, evictions); `CacheKit:Memoize(fn, options)`
   for one string-or-number key; `CacheKit:NewSnapshot(read, options)` where
   `read(fill)` calls `fill(key, value)`, with `Refresh()` returning added, removed and changed keys without
   allocating per unchanged key; `cache:ClearOn(eventName)` when eventKit
   is present.
5. Ownership: caches are owned by their creator and closed with `Close()`;
   clear-on-event connections are released on `Close`. An upgrade keeps
   entries.
6. Performance: LRU is an intrusive doubly linked list over a hash; `Get`
   and `Set` are O(1) and allocate only for a new entry; eviction reuses
   entry tables from a bounded free list. `maxEntries` is required, so no
   cache is unbounded.
7. Tests: eviction order, TTL expiry with the clock stub, memoise hit and
   miss, snapshot diff, clear-on-event, `Close`, allocation guard, upgrade.
8. Docs: README, API.md, INTERNALS.md (list and free-list layout),
   CHANGELOG.
9. Status: implemented (package B1, 0.1.0).

**profileKit** — facade `ProfileKit`

1. Package `profileKit`, facade `ProfileKit`, API generation 1.
2. Purpose: measure the framework and its consumers inside the client:
   named sections with call count, total time, worst spike and last time;
   a report; zero cost when off. Non-goals: memory profiling, per-frame
   graphs, anything shipped enabled.
3. Dependencies: registry API 2; `debugprofilestop` for CPU time (the
   measurement is disabled, not failing, when absent).
4. Surface: `ProfileKit:Enable()` / `Disable()` / `IsEnabled()`,
   `ProfileKit:Section(name)` returning a section with `Begin()` and
   `End()`; `ProfileKit:Measure(name, fn, ...)` returning fn's results;
   `ProfileKit:Report()` returning a sorted array of `{ name, count,
   total, max, last }`; `ProfileKit:Reset()`. When disabled, `Begin`,
   `End` and `Measure` are no-ops bound at enable time so callers pay a
   table read and a call.
5. Ownership: package-level state, bounded by `maxSections` (default 256,
   further sections refused with a reason).
6. Performance: `Begin` and `End` allocate nothing; `Report` allocates by
   design and says so. Enabled overhead is two clock reads per section.
7. Tests: disabled path is a no-op, enable and measure with the clock stub,
   nested sections, spike and last, `Measure` passing results and errors
   through, cap refusal, `Reset`, upgrade.
8. Docs: README, API.md, CHANGELOG; a DEVELOPMENT.md paragraph on
   measuring a Kit change.
9. Status: implemented (package B1, 0.1.0).

#### Package C — the consumer story

- [ ] `schemaKit` — sealed schemas with structured failures, shared by
      settings, options and messaging.
- [ ] `settingsKit` — saved variables with scopes, wildcard defaults,
      profiles and versioned migrations (v1: profiles; v2: spec-aware profiles
      and namespaces).
- [ ] `localeKit` — translations per locale, missing-key reporting, indexed
      format specifiers.
- [ ] `hookKit` — secure-first, reversible hooking, released with the module.
- [ ] **signalKit** — a named message bus with a validated topic policy.
- [ ] `optionsKit` — typed, validated, introspectable options schema with no
      renderer.
- [ ] `commandKit` — slash commands, hyperlink-aware argument parsing,
      output sinks, schema binding, tab completion.

#### Package D — interoperability and distribution

- [ ] `codecKit` — serialise, compress and channel-encode as three stages
      behind a one-byte header; asynchronous variants under the scheduler
      budget.
- [ ] `commKit` — addon messaging: prefixes, chunking, bounded reassembly,
      priority queues that reject rather than grow, content-hash sync sets.
- [ ] `mediaKit` — a typed media registry mirroring LibSharedMedia when it is
      present.
- [ ] **registry** — the LibStub bridge (expose to LibStub, adopt from it).
- [ ] `testKit` — test suites that run inside the client.
- [ ] A publish workflow on tags through the packager to the addon sites, in
      dry-run until the site projects exist.

#### Package E — the last and largest

- [ ] `widgetKit` — pooled, versioned widgets and layout, consumed by
      `optionsKit`.
- [ ] Update `docs/EMBEDDING.md`, the example addon and the package bundle for
      every new Kit; final acceptance review.

### Standing obligations

These apply to every phase rather than being completed once.

- [ ] Keep public APIs documented and version-aware.
- [ ] Add a regression test for every fixed defect.
- [ ] Preserve deterministic lifecycle and ownership semantics.
- [ ] Preserve bounded-by-default retention, caching, scheduling, and pooling.
- [ ] Keep hot paths allocation-conscious and avoid unnecessary table/function creation.
- [ ] Maintain explicit cleanup and teardown paths for long-lived runtime objects.
- [ ] Keep package dependencies minimal, explicit, and acyclic.
- [ ] Maintain manifest, Registry key, package ID, and runtime facade naming consistency.
- [ ] Keep LuaLS/LuaCATS-facing documentation useful for autocomplete and editor tooling.
- [ ] Validate behavior against supported World of Warcraft environments as packages evolve.
- [ ] Keep CI, linting, formatting, repository validation, and test tooling current.

## Planned package policy

Future Kits should be added to this section **when their scope and name are
accepted**, before or together with implementation. Each planned Kit should
record:

1. package ID and runtime facade name;
2. purpose and non-goals;
3. dependencies;
4. public API surface;
5. lifecycle/ownership model;
6. performance and memory constraints;
7. test plan;
8. documentation requirements;
9. implementation status.

This prevents speculative package names from becoming accidental architecture.

## Definition of done for a Kit

A Kit is considered complete for its initial release when:

- [ ] its responsibility and boundaries are documented;
- [ ] its manifest and Registry integration are correct;
- [ ] its public API follows framework naming and documentation conventions;
- [ ] normal, error, edge-case, re-entrant, and teardown paths are reviewed;
- [ ] ownership and lifecycle behavior are explicit;
- [ ] retained state is bounded by default where applicable;
- [ ] performance-sensitive paths avoid unnecessary allocation and work;
- [ ] escape hatches are explicit, documented, and observable where applicable;
- [ ] automated tests cover core behavior and regressions;
- [ ] repository validation passes;
- [ ] package documentation and changelog are current.

## Roadmap maintenance

`docs/ROADMAP.md` is the canonical roadmap in repository artifacts. Whenever a
Kit is added, completed, renamed, split, or removed, this file should be updated
in the same change. Architecture decisions belong in the architecture/design
documents; this roadmap tracks sequencing and delivery status rather than
duplicating those specifications.

Last roadmap baseline update: 2026-09-22 (phases 0 through 3 complete; phase 4
is the next sequenced work).
