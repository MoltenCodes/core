# MoltenCodes WoW Framework Roadmap

## Status

The framework is developed incrementally as small, reusable packages. Public
framework packages follow the Apple-like `Kit` convention:

- package IDs use **lowerCamelCase** (for example, `signalKit`)
- Lua/runtime facades use **PascalCase** (for example, `SignalKit`)
- `registry` / `Registry` is the infrastructure exception

Performance is a first-class requirement. New packages must minimize CPU time,
allocations, garbage-collector pressure, and retained memory. Caches and pools
must be bounded by default. Explicit developer opt-in escape hatches may relax
those defaults when they are documented and observable.

## Completed foundation

- [x] `registry`
- [x] `signalKit`
- [x] `eventKit`
- [x] `lifecycleKit`
- [x] `moduleKit`
- [x] `schedulerKit`
- [x] `timerKit`
- [x] `poolKit`

These entries describe packages present in this repository snapshot. A checked
item means its implementation is part of the repository; it does not mean the
package can never receive further optimization, fixes, or API refinement.

## Ongoing framework work

Work is sequenced in phases. A phase is finished when every checkbox in it is
ticked; later phases may start early only where they do not depend on an
unfinished item above them.

### Phase 0 — Green

Make every repository gate pass, so that later correctness work has a trustworthy
baseline to measure against.

- [x] Test support modules stop relying on Busted's injected globals: stub
      preconditions raise plain errors, genuine expectations `require("luassert")`.
- [x] Bootstrap specs clear the `package.loaded` sentinel between attempts so
      every bootstrap guard they claim to cover is really executed.
- [x] `tooling/test/run.py` runs every selected package, prints a per-package
      summary table, and exits non-zero when any package failed.
- [x] `tooling/test/run.py` names a concrete Lua 5.1 toolchain source when
      Busted is missing from `PATH`.
- [x] Tooling modules set `__doc__` (docstring above `from __future__ import`).
- [x] Selene reports zero errors and zero warnings; deliberate `_G` access is
      annotated per site with a reason.
- [x] `stylua --check .` passes across the repository.
- [x] `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` documents the concrete toolchain install path and
      troubleshooting.

### Phase 1 — Correctness fixes per package

Defects and hardening found by review, one package at a time. Every fix carries a
regression test.

- [x] **eventKit** — enforce the World of Warcraft unit-token limit on
      `ConnectUnit`/`OnceUnit` rather than letting the client silently truncate.
- [x] **eventKit** — isolate listeners at the event-bus boundary so one failing
      listener cannot stop delivery to the rest.
- [x] **eventKit** — bound the number of unit-group frames a single addon can
      cause to be created.
- [x] **eventKit** — audit `error` levels so messages point at the caller's line.
- [x] **moduleKit** — track the dispatched phase per module so an in-place
      upgrade never re-enables a module that was explicitly disabled.
- [x] **schedulerKit** — measure the frame budget as CPU time via
      `debugprofilestop` instead of wall-clock elapsed time.
- [x] **schedulerKit** — stop failing cooperating jobs when one job in the same
      frame raises.
- [x] **schedulerKit** — capture a traceback at the point of failure rather than
      after the stack has unwound.
- [x] **schedulerKit** — document the Lua 5.1 rule that a coroutine cannot yield
      across a `pcall` boundary, and make the API shape that rule explicit.
- [x] **registry** — let two API generations of the same package coexist instead
      of the newer one displacing the older.
- [x] **signalKit** — validate receivers at connect time.
- [x] **signalKit** — make disconnect cheaper than the current linear scan.
- [x] **timerKit** — audit `error` levels and correct the documentation that
      describes them.
- [x] **poolKit** — audit `error` levels and correct the documentation that
      describes them.

### Phase 2 — Consumer story

Everything an addon author needs in order to actually embed a package.

- [ ] Write `docs/EMBEDDING.md` covering `.toc` entries, required load order,
      supported Interface numbers, coexistence with LibStub-based libraries,
      taint rules, and the combat-log (CLEU) constraints.
- [ ] Add `.pkgmeta` and the packaging metadata the standard addon packagers
      expect.
- [ ] Give every public surface LuaCATS annotations so editors and the language
      server describe the API correctly.

### Phase 3 — Engineering system

Repository mechanics that keep the above honest as the framework grows.

- [ ] Pin every GitHub Action to a commit SHA rather than a moving tag.
- [ ] Run Selene over test code too, using a Busted std definition.
- [ ] Add a Python version floor row to the CI matrix so the documented minimum
      is actually exercised.
- [ ] Cache the Selene build in CI instead of recompiling it on every run.
- [ ] Extract the repeated WoW-API stubs into one shared test-support fixture.
- [ ] Add a `Registry:Bootstrap` helper so packages stop copying the same
      bootstrap preamble.
- [ ] Write `packages/moduleKit/docs/INTERNALS.md` describing the dependency
      graph and resolution order.

### Phase 4 — New Kits

- [ ] Record the nine points from "Planned package policy" below for a Kit
      **before** implementing it.
- [ ] Implement accepted Kits one at a time, each meeting the definition of done.

### Standing obligations

These apply to every phase rather than being completed once.

- [ ] Keep public APIs documented and version-aware.
- [ ] Add a regression test for every fixed defect.
- [ ] Preserve deterministic lifecycle and ownership semantics.
- [ ] Preserve bounded-by-default retention, caching, scheduling, and pooling.
- [ ] Keep hot paths allocation-conscious and avoid unnecessary table/function creation.
- [ ] Maintain explicit cleanup and teardown paths for long-lived runtime objects.
- [ ] Keep package dependencies minimal, explicit, and acyclic.
- [ ] Maintain manifest, Registry key, package ID, and runtime facade naming consistency.
- [ ] Keep LuaLS/LuaCATS-facing documentation useful for autocomplete and editor tooling.
- [ ] Validate behavior against supported World of Warcraft environments as packages evolve.
- [ ] Keep CI, linting, formatting, repository validation, and test tooling current.

## Planned package policy

Future Kits should be added to this section **when their scope and name are
accepted**, before or together with implementation. Each planned Kit should
record:

1. package ID and runtime facade name;
2. purpose and non-goals;
3. dependencies;
4. public API surface;
5. lifecycle/ownership model;
6. performance and memory constraints;
7. test plan;
8. documentation requirements;
9. implementation status.

This prevents speculative package names from becoming accidental architecture.

## Definition of done for a Kit

A Kit is considered complete for its initial release when:

- [ ] its responsibility and boundaries are documented;
- [ ] its manifest and Registry integration are correct;
- [ ] its public API follows framework naming and documentation conventions;
- [ ] normal, error, edge-case, re-entrant, and teardown paths are reviewed;
- [ ] ownership and lifecycle behavior are explicit;
- [ ] retained state is bounded by default where applicable;
- [ ] performance-sensitive paths avoid unnecessary allocation and work;
- [ ] escape hatches are explicit, documented, and observable where applicable;
- [ ] automated tests cover core behavior and regressions;
- [ ] repository validation passes;
- [ ] package documentation and changelog are current.

## Roadmap maintenance

`docs/ROADMAP.md` is the canonical roadmap in repository artifacts. Whenever a
Kit is added, completed, renamed, split, or removed, this file should be updated
in the same change. Architecture decisions belong in the architecture/design
documents; this roadmap tracks sequencing and delivery status rather than
duplicating those specifications.
