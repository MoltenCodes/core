# Tooling

Repository tooling lives under `tooling/` and is never a runtime dependency.

## Current tooling

```text
tooling/
├── lint.py                         # discovers and lints runtime and test Lua
├── package/
│   └── build.py                   # assembles a checksummed distributable bundle
├── test/
│   └── run.py                     # package-aware Busted orchestration
├── tests/                         # Python unit tests for repository tooling
└── validation/
    ├── validate_manifests.py      # manifest schema and dependency graph checks
    └── validate_repository.py     # structure, editor configuration and link checks
```

`tooling/test/` (singular) is the Busted orchestration package; `tooling/tests/`
(plural) is the tooling's own unit-test suite. The names differ by one letter, so
`tooling/tests/__init__.py` states which is which. Neither directory is renamed:
both names appear in this document, in `DEVELOPMENT.md`, in the editor tasks and
in the CI workflow.

## Supported Python

`pyproject.toml` declares `requires-python = ">=3.10"` and carries no build
backend, because nothing under `tooling/` is packaged or published. The file
exists so the floor is written down once, in a machine-readable place.

`python3 -m tooling.validation.validate_repository` refuses to certify the
repository from an older interpreter, and checks that the declaration and the
constant in the validator still agree, so the two cannot drift apart. Every CI
job that runs repository tooling — the Lua tests, the linter, repository
validation and the release build — runs on both the floor and the release
developers use, so the documented minimum is exercised rather than merely
asserted. There is no exemption: a job that could only run on the newer
interpreter would make the floor a claim instead of a supported version.

The canonical commands are documented in [`DEVELOPMENT.md`](DEVELOPMENT.md).

## Design rules

- Tooling discovers packages from repository structure and manifests.
- Runtime code never imports or depends on tooling.
- CI and editor tasks call repository tooling instead of duplicating package lists.
- Tooling should be deterministic and produce actionable repository-relative errors.
- Prefer the Python standard library for repository tooling until a third-party dependency provides clear value.
- New tooling must have focused unit tests when its behavior is more than a trivial command wrapper.
- Tooling reports the whole picture before it fails. The test runner executes every selected target and prints one summary table rather than stopping at the first failing one, and the linter runs both of its scopes before reporting.
- Tooling runs on the Python floor `pyproject.toml` declares. New tooling must not use syntax or standard-library APIs newer than that.

## Lint policy: deliberate `_G` access

Selene's `global_usage` lint is deliberately left at its default severity in
[`selene.toml`](../selene.toml) instead of being switched off for the whole
repository.

Runtime packages legitimately touch `_G` in exactly two situations: reading a
World of Warcraft client API that the client publishes only as a global
(`CreateFrame`, `C_Timer`, `C_AddOns`, `IsLoggedIn`, `GetTimePreciseSec`,
`geterrorhandler`, Lua 5.1's `unpack`), and reading or creating the shared
`MoltenCodes` namespace and Registry state key through which independently
embedded copies find each other.

Each of those sites carries a one-line reason followed by the narrowest possible
suppression:

```lua
-- C_Timer is a World of Warcraft client API reachable only through the global table.
-- selene: allow(global_usage)
local wowTimerApi = rawget(_G, "C_Timer")
```

A Selene filtering comment applies to the statement that immediately follows it,
so this silences one access and nothing else. Disabling the lint repository-wide
would have been one line, but it would also silence the next `_G` access nobody
intended, which is precisely the case Design Constitution principle 9 ("No
hidden global state") exists to catch. The annotation makes every crossing of
that boundary visible in review and in `git grep global_usage`.

Test code follows the same rule. A spec that installs a fake `CreateFrame`, or
the shared fixture that stands in for the client's whole global environment,
touches `_G` deliberately and says so per site. The lint is not switched off for
test code, because "this file is a test" is not by itself a reason for any
particular global write.

## Lint scopes: runtime Lua and test Lua

`python3 -m tooling.lint` runs Selene twice, over two file sets, with two
standard libraries:

| Scope | Files | Configuration |
|---|---|---|
| runtime Lua | `packages/*/src/**`, `examples/*.lua` | [`selene.toml`](../selene.toml) |
| test Lua | `packages/*/tests/**`, `examples/tests/**`, `tests/support/**` | [`selene-tests.toml`](../selene-tests.toml) |

Both scopes run even when the first fails, so one broken scope cannot hide the
other. The example addon's own source is runtime code and is held to the runtime
standard: a Busted global there would be a real defect.

The only difference between the two is the standard library.
[`busted.yml`](../busted.yml) takes `lua51` as its base and adds what Busted
injects into a spec chunk — `describe`, `it`, `before_each`, `finally`,
`pending`, and luassert's `assert`, `spy`, `stub`, `mock` and `match`. Without
it every matcher chain reads as either an undefined variable or as misuse of
Lua's own one-argument `assert`.

It also *corrects* one entry rather than adding it: Lua 5.1's `error` accepts any
value as the error object, not only a string, and specs that prove the framework
preserves a `nil` or `false` error object depend on that. The bundled `lua51`
description says `string`. Because a chained std (`lua51+busted`) can only add
entries, `busted.yml` declares `base: lua51` and redefines `error` outright. The
runtime `selene.toml` keeps the stricter default.

## Release tooling

`tooling/package/build.py` assembles the distributable bundle: it copies each
package's runtime sources and package-owned documentation into the layout an
addon embeds, writes a `manifest.json` describing versions, revisions, licences
and the load order, and writes SHA-256 checksums into `CHECKSUMS.txt`.

It is deliberately deterministic — no timestamps in the artifact, fixed zip entry
times — so two builds of the same commit produce identical checksums. It fails
closed on invalid package metadata but does not run the test suite, the linter or
the formatter; those are separate commands and remain the caller's responsibility.

`--verify` reads the `CHECKSUMS.txt` it has just written back and holds it
against the files on disk. It reports a recorded file that is missing, a
recorded file whose contents no longer hash to what was written down, and a file
inside the bundle that nothing records at all, and it exits non-zero if it finds
any of them. Bundles from earlier builds that the checksum file does not
describe are left alone, so a single-package bundle sitting beside the full one
is not mistaken for an unrecorded file.

CI builds the whole framework into a temporary directory on every run and checks
the result twice: once with `--verify`, and once with `sha256sum --check
--strict`, which is what somebody who downloads the artifact would use. The
first proves the file is correct, the second proves it is also readable by the
standard tool.

[`../docs/RELEASES.md`](../docs/RELEASES.md) documents the command line, the
artifact layout, and the relationship to [`../.pkgmeta`](../.pkgmeta), which is
what the addon-site packagers build from.

## Future tooling

Tooling is added only when implemented. Empty placeholder directories are intentionally avoided because they imply capabilities that do not yet exist.

Likely future responsibilities include:

- dependency-aware build ordering;
- affected-package test selection;
- release validation and publication.
